Data structures are a fundamental concept in computer science and programming. They are used to organize and store data in a way that makes it easy to access and manipulate. In this unit, we will explore various data structures and how they are used in programming.

## What Will You Learn

- Understand what data structures are and how they work
- Learn about different types of data structures, such as numbers, strings, arrays, linked lists, maps, and more
- Understand the tradeoffs and benefits of different data structures in various situations
- Learn how to choose the right data structure for a given problem
- Understand common operations and algorithms associated with different data structures

By the end of this unit, you will have a solid understanding of data structures and how they are used in programming. You will be able to make informed decisions about which data structures to use in different situations code. This knowledge is essential for writing efficient and effective software, and will help you become a better programmer overall.
