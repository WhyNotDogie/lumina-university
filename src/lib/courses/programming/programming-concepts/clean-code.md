Clean code is the art of writing code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. It's about writing code that is not only functional, but also elegant and efficient.

When you write clean code, it's like writing a good book. You want the code to flow and be easy to understand, with a clear structure and a logical flow.

Writing clean code is important because it helps you and other programmers work more efficiently. It reduces the time it takes to understand code, and makes it easier to find and fix bugs. Clean code also helps reduce technical debt, which is the cost of maintaining and modifying code that is difficult to understand or modify.
