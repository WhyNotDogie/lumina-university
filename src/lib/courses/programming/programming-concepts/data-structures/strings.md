- Learn about the different methods used to manipulate strings

## Strings

A string is a sequence of characters. In programming, a string is used to represent text, including letters, numbers, and special characters. Strings are a fundamental data type in many programming languages and are used extensively in many applications.

## Differences Between Strings and Characters

A character is a single symbol, such as a letter, number, or special character. A string, on the other hand, is a sequence of characters. In programming, a string is represented using quotes, such as "Hello, World!". A single character is represented using single quotes, such as 'A'.

## Manipulating Strings

Strings can be manipulated in many ways in programming. Some common string manipulation methods include:

- **Concatenation**: Concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings into a single string. This can be done using the + operator in many programming languages.
- **Substring**: A substring is a portion of a string. Substrings can be extracted from a string using various string manipulation methods.
- **Replacing**: Replacing is the process of replacing a portion of a string with another string. This can be done using various string manipulation methods.
