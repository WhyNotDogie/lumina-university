# Refactoring

## What will you learn

In this unit, you will learn about refactoring, the process of restructuring code to improve its readability, maintainability, and efficiency. You'll learn about the principles of good code design and how to apply them to improve existing code.

## Introduction to Refactoring

Refactoring is the process of improving code without changing its behavior. It's like cleaning up a room: you rearrange the furniture, throw away the trash, and put things in their proper places, all to make the room more comfortable and efficient.

The same goes for code: you rearrange code, remove unused variables or functions, and organize the code in a way that makes it easier to understand, all to make it more efficient and easier to maintain.

## Why Refactor Code?

Code is constantly evolving. As we add new features, fix bugs, and maintain code, it's easy for it to become cluttered and difficult to work with. Refactoring code is a way to clean it up, making it more efficient, easier to maintain, and less prone to bugs.

Some reasons to refactor code include:

- **Improving readability**: By cleaning up the code and making it more readable, you make it easier for other developers to understand the code and collaborate with you.
- **Improving maintainability**: By organizing the code and reducing its complexity, you make it easier to maintain and extend the code over time.
- **Improving performance**: By removing redundant code, you can improve the performance of your application.
- **Reducing bugs**: By organizing the code and making it easier to understand, you can reduce the likelihood of introducing bugs into the code.

## Principles of Good Code Design

When refactoring code, it's important to follow principles of good code design. Some of these principles include:

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid duplicating code. Instead, create functions or modules that can be reused throughout your application.
- **KISS** **(Keep It Stupid Simple)** is definitely a key principle of clean code, and it emphasises the importance of writing code that is easy to understand, maintain, and modify.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Instead, they should depend on abstractions and interfaces. This makes it possible to change the underlying low-level functionality without affecting the high level modules.

## How to Refactor Code

When refactoring code, you want to make changes in small, manageable steps. Here are some steps to follow:

1. **Understand the code**: Before making any changes, make sure you understand the code and its purpose.
2. **Identify areas for improvement**: Look for areas where the code can be improved, such as duplicated code, overly complex logic, or poor variable names.
3. **Write tests**: Before making any changes, write tests to ensure that the code works correctly.
4. **Make changes in small steps**: Make small changes to the code, test each change to make sure it works correctly, and then move on to the next change.
5. **Document your changes**: As you make changes, document them so that others can understand the changes you've made.
6. **Refactor regularly**: Refactoring should be an ongoing process, not a one-time event. Regularly review and improve your code to keep it clean and efficient.
