# Building Blocks for Your Future

Welcome to our programming course! In this unit, you will learn the fundamental concepts of programming that form the building blocks of modern software development. By the end of this course, you will have a solid principles that guide software development, and be well on your way to becoming a skilled programmer.

## The Power of Programming

Programming is a powerful tool that can transform the world we live in. Through programming, we can create new technologies, solve complex problems, and make our lives easier and more enjoyable. Programming is a valuable skill that can open up countless opportunities for personal and professional growth.

## What this course is

The early stages of this course will be touching primarily on the universal concepts used across all programming languages and programming paradigms, so we introduce you to all the necessary terminology, concepts and ideas that are used in programming.

With this foundational base knowledge, we will then move on to actual programming, where you will get your hands dirty.

:::note

The early stages of this course will be dedicated to introducing you to programming theory, and we will be learning the universal concepts that apply across all programming languages, because of this we will be using lots of **pseudocode**

Pseudocode is a simple to understand natural language that removes the complication of learning code and syntax. As a programmer, before you start actually coding, you should always plan the code using pseudo code.

We will move into real programming in the later stages
