In HTML, elements can be placed inside other elements in a process known as **nesting**. This is a fundamental concept in HTML and is essential for creating complex web page structures.

## What is Nesting?

Nesting involves placing one or more HTML elements inside another HTML element. The element that contains other elements is called the **parent element**, and the elements inside it are called **child elements**.

Here's an example of nesting:

:::renderer
```html
<div>
    <div>This is a div inside another div element.</div>
</div>
```
:::

In this example, the outer `<div>` tag is the parent element, and the inner `<div>` tag is the child element.

The div is not visible on the page, but with CSS, we can style it to make it more visible:

:::renderer
```html
<div>
    <div>
        This is a div inside a div element.
    </div>
</div>
```
```css
div {
    border: 1px solid red;
    padding: 10px;
}
```
:::


## Why Do We Nest Elements?

Nesting elements allows us to create more complex layouts and apply styles to groups of elements. For example, we might use a `<div>` element to group several `<p>` elements together so that we can apply the same style to all of them at once.

## Best Practices for Nesting

**Indentation:** To keep your code readable, always indent child elements. This makes it clear which elements are nested within others.

```html
<div>
    <p>This is a nested paragraph.</p>
</div>
```

**Close Tags in the Correct Order:** Always close your tags in the reverse order that you opened them. This helps ensure that your elements are properly nested.

:::error
Incorrect tag closing order:
```html
<div><p>This is incorrect.</div></p>
```
:::

:::tip
Correct tag closing order:
```html
<div><p>This is correct.</p></div>
```

Nesting is a **critical concept** in HTML that you'll use frequently as you build web pages. Understanding how to properly nest elements will help you create more complex and organized structures in your HTML documents.
