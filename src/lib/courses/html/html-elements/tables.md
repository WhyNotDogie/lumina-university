An HTML table is a way to arrange data into rows and columns, similar to tables you might see in Excel or Google Sheets. Tables are particularly useful for organizing and displaying data in a structured and easy-to-understand format.

:::note
Although tables can be used to help structure the layout of a webpage, it is generally better practice to use CSS for page layout and reserve tables for displaying tabular data.

## Basic Table Structure

A table is created in HTML using the `<table>` tag. The table is then filled with rows, created with the `<tr>` tag (table row), and these rows are filled with data using the `<td>` tag (table data).

Here's an example of a simple table:

:::renderer
```css
td {
  border: 1px solid white;
}
```
```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
:::

This table contains two rows and two columns.

:::tip
Remember, each cell in the table is marked up with the `<td>` tag and each row with the `<tr>` tag.

## Table Headers

You can also use the `<th>` tag (table header) to define a header cell in a table. Header cells are usually used to label the columns and rows, and by default, the text in `<th>` elements are bold and centered.

:::renderer
```css
td {
  border: 1px solid white;
}
th {
    border: 1px solid white;
}
```
```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Header 1</th>
    <th>Header 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
:::

## Table Caption

The `<caption>` tag is used to add a title to your table. It must be inserted immediately after the `<table>` tag.


:::renderer
```html
<table>
  <caption>Table Title</caption>
  <tr>
    <th>Header 1</th>
    <th>Header 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

:::error
Avoid using tables for layout. It's a common beginner's mistake to use tables to structure the entire layout of a webpage. This is considered bad practice and can lead to issues with accessibility and responsiveness. Always use CSS for layout purposes.

Tables are a versatile tool for displaying structured data on a webpage. Understanding how to create and manipulate tables is a crucial skill in HTML. Remember to only use tables for their intended purpose: displaying tabular data. With that in mind, happy coding!
