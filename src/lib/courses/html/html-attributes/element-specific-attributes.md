In HTML, attributes are used to provide additional information about an element or to modify its behavior. While some attributes can be applied to all elements, others are specific to certain elements. These are known as **Element-specific Attributes**.

Here, we will cover a few examples of element-specific attributes. Remember that this is not an exhaustive list, as HTML has many elements, each with its own set of attributes.

## Table of Element-specific Attributes

Here's an extensive list of some element-specific attributes in HTML:
