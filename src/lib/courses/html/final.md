## What We've Learned

Throughout this course, we've covered:

- **What is HTML**: We've learned that HTML is the standard language used for creating and structuring content on the web.
- **HTML tags and elements**: We've delved into the basics of HTML tags, understanding how they shape and format the content on a web page.
- **HTML Document Structure**: We've explored the anatomy of a basic HTML document, including `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>`.
- **HTML Attributes**: We've seen how attributes can modify HTML elements, providing additional information about them.

## What's Next?

As you've probably noticed while learning HTML, websites aren't just composed of text and simple formatting. They have complex designs, animations, interactivity, and much more. This is where CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, comes into play.

Your next step is to learn CSS! CSS is a style-sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. With CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, and much more!
