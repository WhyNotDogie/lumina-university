## HTML - The Blueprint of a Website

HTML stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**. It is the standard language used to create and design websites. HTML allows you to structure your content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links, in a way that is easy to read and understand for both humans and web browsers.

Imagine building a house. The HTML is like the blueprint of the house, which shows where the walls, doors, and windows will be placed. Similarly, HTML helps you define the structure and layout of your website.

**Analogy:** Think of HTML as the skeleton of a website. It provides the basic structure, while other languages like CSS and JavaScript add the style and interactivity.

## Building Blocks of HTML

HTML is composed of elements, which are the building blocks of a web page. Each element is represented by a set of **tags**. There are two types of tags: opening tags (e.g., `<p>`) and closing tags (e.g., `</p>`). The content of the element is placed between these tags.

Elements can also have **attributes** that provide additional information about the element. Attributes are added within the opening tag of an element and consist of a name-value pair, such as `src="image.jpg"`.

In the upcoming subunits, we will dive deeper into these concepts, and you'll get hands-on experience with creating your own HTML documents. Get ready to explore the fascinating world of web development!
