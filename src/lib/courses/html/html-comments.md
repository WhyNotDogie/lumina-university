Comments in HTML are text blocks that are ignored by the browser. They are primarily used to provide explanatory notes to the HTML source code for developers. Comments can be very helpful in understanding the purpose and functionality of certain sections of your code when revisiting your work or when others need to understand your code.

## How to Write a Comment in HTML?

To write a comment in HTML, you use the `<!-- -->` tags. Everything between these tags becomes a comment and will not be rendered by the browser.

Here's an example of a comment in HTML:

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
```

## Why Use HTML Comments?

HTML comments can be used for several purposes:

1. **Explain your code:** Comments are a great way to explain what specific parts of your code do, making it easier for others (or yourself at a later date) to understand your work.
2. **Hide code:** You can use comments to prevent certain parts of your code from being executed. This can be useful when you're testing different sections of your code.
3. **Leave notes for others:** If you're working on a team project, you can use comments to leave notes for your colleagues.

:::warning
Generally, comments are not used as they increase the size of your HTML document, and make it slower to load

However, they can be useful in certain situations, such as those mentioned above.

Although comments are not visible to users, they can be seen by viewing the page source. Therefore, never include sensitive information in your HTML comments.
