## Bits and Binary Code

A bit is the smallest unit of data that can be stored or manipulated in a digital computer. It can have a value of either 0 or 1. Computers use bits to represent all types of data, including numbers, text, images, and videos.

In binary code, each digit can have a value of 0 or 1, which corresponds to the two possible states of an electronic switch. By combining multiple bits, we can represent larger possibilities and more complex data types. More about this in later sections.

**Memory Layout of Booleans**

Because CPUs generally address memory as bytes, a boolean will typically occupy 1 byte (or 8 bits) instead of a single bit.

## Boolean Logic

Boolean logic is a type of logic that deals with true/false or yes/no decisions. It's named after George Boole, who developed the concept in the mid-19th century. In programming, boolean values are represented using the keywords "true" and "false". They are used to make decisions in a program and control the flow of execution.

Boolean operators such as "and", "or", and "not" can be used to combine multiple boolean values and perform more complex operations.
