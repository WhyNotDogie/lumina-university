Trees and graphs are fundamental data structures used to represent relationships between objects. In programming, trees and graphs are used to model a wide range of systems and data, such as file systems, networks, and social relationships. In this unit, we will explore when and why to use trees and graphs, as well as some example use cases.

## What Will You Learn

- Understand what trees and graphs are and how they work
- Learn about the differences between trees and graphs
- Explore when and why to use trees and graphs in programming
- Learn about common use cases for trees and graphs

## Trees

A tree is a type of data structure that represents a hierarchical relationship between objects. Each object in the tree is called a node, and nodes can have children that are also nodes. The topmost node in the tree is called the root node, and nodes with no children are called leaf nodes.

Trees are useful when you need to store and access data in a hierarchical manner, such as representing file systems or organization charts.

## Graphs

A graph is a type of data structure that represents a set of objects and the relationships between them. Objects in a graph are called vertices or nodes, and relationships between them are called edges. Graphs can be directed, where edges have a direction, or undirected, where edges have no direction.

Graphs are useful when you need to model a system with many relationships between objects, such as a social network or a network of computer systems.

## When to Use Trees & Graphs

Here are some common scenarios where trees or graphs are used:

### Trees

- **File systems**: File systems are often represented as trees, with directories as parent nodes and files as leaf nodes.
- **Organization charts**: Organization charts can be represented as trees, with each node representing a person and their position in the organization.
- **HTML/XML**: HTML and XML documents are often represented as trees, with tags as nodes and their attributes as child nodes.
- **Hierarchical Structures**: such as blocks of content in text editors, where some blocks contain other blocks and inline content.

### Graphs

- **Social networks**: Social networks can be represented as graphs, with users as vertices and their relationships (friendship, following, etc.) as edges.
- **Computer networks**: Computer networks can be represented as graphs, with computers as vertices and connections between them as edges.
- **Finding connections**: Graphs can be used to find connections between objects, such as finding the shortest path between two cities in a transportation network.
- **Recommendation systems**: Graphs can be used to make recommendations based on relationships between objects, such as recommending movies based on the movies that a user has watched and enjoyed.
- **Routing algorithms**: Routing algorithms in networking use graphs to represent the connections between network devices.
