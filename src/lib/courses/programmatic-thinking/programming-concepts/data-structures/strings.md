In programming, a string is a data type used to represent text. Strings are a fundamental data type in many programming languages and are used extensively in many applications. In this unit, we will explore what strings are and how they are used in programming.

## Strings

A string is a **sequence of characters**. In programming, a string is used to represent text, including letters, numbers, and special characters. Strings are a fundamental data type in many programming languages and are used extensively in many applications.

Strings are often internally implemented as an array or `Vec` of characters. For example, the string `"Hello, World!"` is represented as the following array of characters:

```rust
['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ',', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!']
```

> This means that characters can be iterated in much the same way as other collections.

## Differences Between Strings and Characters

A character is a single symbol, such as a letter, number, or special character. A string, on the other hand, is a sequence of characters. In programming, a string is represented using quotes, such as `"Hello, World!"`. A single character is represented using single quotes, such as `'A'`.

## Manipulating Strings

Strings can be manipulated in many ways in programming. Some common string manipulation methods include:

- **Concatenation**: Concatenation is the process of combining or joining two or more strings into a single string.
- **Substring**: A substring is a portion of a string. Substrings can be extracted from a string using various string manipulation methods.
- **Replacing**: Replacing is the process of replacing a portion of a string with another string.
- **Splitting**: Splitting is the process of splitting a string into multiple substrings.
- **Trimming**: Trimming is the process of removing whitespace from the beginning and end of a string.
- **Case Conversion**: Case conversion is the process of converting a string from one case to another.
- **Searching**: Searching is the process of searching for a substring within a string.
- **Encoding**: Encoding is the process of converting a string into a different encoding.
- **Decoding**: Decoding is the process of converting a string from one encoding to another.
