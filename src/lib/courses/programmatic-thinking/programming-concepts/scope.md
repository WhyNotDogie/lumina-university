Scope is an essential concept in programming that helps determine where a variable, function, or object can be accessed within your code. It can be used to control the visibility and lifetime of variables and functions, which ultimately improves the readability and maintainability of your code.

In this unit, we will explore the different types of scope, including global and local/block scope, closures and nested functions, namespaces and modules, and privacy.

We will also discuss best practices for working with scope, as well as common anti-patterns that should be avoided.
