Sequential logic is a fundamental concept in programming that refers to the order in which statements are executed. In this unit, we will explore the basics of sequential logic, including blocks, statements, and expressions.

## What Will You Learn

- Understand the basics of sequential logic in programming
- Learn about blocks, statements, and expressions
- See how sequential logic is used in programming
- Explore how sequential logic can be used to solve problems

## Blocks

A block is a group of **statements** that are executed together in sequence. In many programming languages, blocks are defined by curly braces `{}` or indentation. Blocks are used to group statements together and define the scope of variables and other program elements.

Some languages such as Python use indentation to define blocks

## Statements

A statement is a generally single instruction or step that performs a specific task in a program. Examples of statements include variable assignments, function calls, and control flow statements (such as if statements and loops).

## Expressions

An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that can be evaluated to produce a single value. Examples of expressions include mathematical calculations, string concatenation, boolean comparisons, or running and evaluating a function.

For example, here's an pseudocode example of code that includes two statements:
- One which assigns the value `5` to the variable `x`
- One which assigns the result of the expression `x multiplied by x` to the variable `result` - with the `result` variable storing the evaluated value of `25`

```
let x be 5
let result be x multipled by x
```

::question{slug="variable-what-is-x" question="What is `x` in this case? Is it a variable, or a value?" context="The answer is `x` is a variable that stores the numeric value `5`. It is not a value"}

::question{slug="variable-what-is-expression" question="is `x multiplied by x` an expression?" context="The answer is `x multiplied by x` is an **expression** that evaluates to the value `25`"}


## Using Sequential Logic

Sequential logic is used in programming to execute instructions in a specific order. By carefully controlling the order in which statements are executed, programmers can create complex programs that solve a wide range of problems.
