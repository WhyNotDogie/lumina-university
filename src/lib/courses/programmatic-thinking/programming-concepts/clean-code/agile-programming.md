- Principles of agile programming
- Common practices in agile programming

Agile programming is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. It focuses on delivering small pieces of working software frequently, and on adapting to changing requirements and feedback from stakeholders.

### Agile Methodology

Agile methodology is a set of values and principles that guide agile programming. The Agile Manifesto, created in 2001, outlines the following values:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Agile Programming

Agile programming has several advantages:

- The customer is involved throughout the development process, resulting in a product that better meets their needs
- Continuous delivery of working software means that problems can be identified and fixed early
- Adaptability to change means that the software can evolve to meet changing business needs
- Collaboration and teamwork between developers and stakeholders leads to better communication and understanding of requirements

However, there are also disadvantages to agile programming:

- The emphasis on working software can lead to less emphasis on documentation, which can lead to difficulties maintaining the software
- The rapid pace of development can lead to technical debt, or the accumulation of poorly written code that must be cleaned up later
- The need for frequent communication and collaboration can be time-consuming and distracting for developers

### Principles of Agile Programming

Agile programming is guided by several principles, including:

- Prioritizing working software over comprehensive documentation
- Emphasizing collaboration between developers and stakeholders
- Adapting to changing requirements and feedback
- Delivering software frequently and incrementally

### Common Practices in Agile Programming

There are several common practices used in agile programming, including:

- Scrum: a framework for managing and completing complex projects
- Kanban: a system for visualizing and managing work
- Pair programming: two developers working on the same task together
- Test-driven development: writing tests before writing code
- Continuous integration: frequently integrating code changes into the main branch

Overall, agile programming is a popular approach to software development due to its focus on delivering working software frequently and adapting to changing requirements. However, it requires a high degree of collaboration and communication between developers and stakeholders, and can lead to technical debt if not managed properly.
